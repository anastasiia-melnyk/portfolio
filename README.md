## Portfolio

Welcome!

You are in my portfolio repository where I share my experience and skills in software testing and development.

This portfolio contains samples of my work. It collects examples of API queries, SQL queries for working with a database, examples of using test design techniques to create tests, as well as test documentation, including test cases, checklists, and bug reports. The repository also provides examples of using test management tools.

Besides, here you will find tasks and code samples in PHP that demonstrate my basic programming skills, as well as projects created using HTML and CSS.

This repository reflects my practical skills in software quality assurance and development. I invite you to familiarize yourself with my work and dive into the world of my professional activities!
